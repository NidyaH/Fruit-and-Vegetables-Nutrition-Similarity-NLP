# Fruit and Vegetables Nutrition Similarity
This project explores the similarity of health benefits between different fruits and vegetables using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Many people know that fruits and vegetables provide valuable nutrients, but it is often difficult to identify alternatives with similar benefits. For example, not everyone realizes that one fruit or vegetable can substitute another because their health effects are alike.
To address this problem, we developed a system that automatically recommends fruits or vegetables with similar benefits. The project uses a dataset containing names and health benefits of various fruits and vegetables. By applying text preprocessing techniques and similarity measurements (both lexical with TF-IDF and semantic with sentence embeddings), the system can analyze and compare the benefits described in natural language.

The output is an interactive program that allows users to:
1. Compare the similarity of benefits between two fruits or vegetables.
2. Find the top five fruits or vegetables with the most similar benefits to a chosen input.
3. This solution helps users make better dietary choices by finding suitable alternatives that meet their nutritional or health needs.
